# Predicting_Volumetric_Drag_Coefficient
In this example we have used data from PHD thesis, “Multi-Objective Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of High Altitude Airships” by Mohammad Irfan Alam and Prof. Rajkumar Pant. Here, m is the Point of maximum diameter r0 is Nose radius r1 is the tail radius Cp is the prismatic coefficient  f is the fineness ratio L is the length of envelope Cdv is Volumetric Drag Coefficient And v is the volume of envelope The low re no is 3.01 x 106 L is the constant and  for high re i.e. 37.6 x 106 V is constant and the result we got is as follow.
From above results we can say that we have succesfully predicted the Volumetric drag coefficient for given reynolds number for different features for unknown envolope.
The conclusion from our result is the error values we get from Machine Learning are too small, So we can say that machine learning is works better than Surrogate Modelling.
